## About this Repo

Greetings Interns. This repo is for our very impressive software that performs a Gray-Scott Simulation.

## Getting Started

This tutorial assumes a basic understanding of git, GitHub and command line usage. If you do not have git installed please follow <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git">this tutorial</a>.

A C++ compiler (minimum C++11) is also required to compile and run this code. Installation is platform- and software-environment-dependent so please research how to install a compiler with your particular setup (you may already have one installed).

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/mananisak/Data-Divers-gray-scott-sim.git
   ```
2. Move into the repo folder

   cd Data-Divers-gray-scott-sim

3. Use Make to compile the files
